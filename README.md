Programming, but in 3D!

## About
CodeBlocks is a project developed by Software Engineering students at the Westphalian University of Applied Science in Bocholt, Germany. It's a small 3D Sandbox to teach enthousiasts and new students to learn programming by placing code-blocks and connecting them. This way, "real" programming is simulated, but simplified.

The idea isn't unique. There are many options available with teaching programming in mind (like Scratch, LEGO Mindstorms, ...). The one thing that makes CodeBlocks different from other solutions is that when executing your "code", the real-life code is generated and displayed. That way, beginner programmers can learn how to program by seeing what their "code" would look like in real life.

Currently CodeBlocks only supports programming with integers and generates C code. It is thus not possible to write complex programs, but the basic/theoretical knowledge acquired in CodeBlocks can be transferred into real-life programming, as the programmer knows how to write a basic program.
